Insallation  
Download and install the latest appropiate version for your Operating system from: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html  
We chose to download the Debian version as Ubuntu is based upon it.  
Google Chrome warns: "this file can harm your computer" after download, just click "keep" and open the file as normal.  
Ubuntu Software Centre should handle the installation so it can handle its remove (if needed).

As it says in the post-install instructions, we need to load RVM into the current environment by running:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
source /home/vagrant/.rvm/scripts/rvm
Note that there will be no output from this command, but you can now see RVM:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
 
which rvm
/home/vagrant/.rvm/bin/rvm
Requirements

The RVM tool has an awesome tool for installing all the various compilers and packages you’ll need to build Ruby and common libraries. Run it like this:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
rvm requirements
Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.1

You can see all the Rubies available through RVM with this command:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
rvm list known
Then install both Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.1:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
$
rvm install 1.9.3
rvm install 2.1
It’ll take awhile to compile.

Default Ruby

You can set either as your default Ruby. For 2.1, run this:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
rvm use 2.1 --default
And verify it:

close  minimize  deactivate
Terminal
$
 
$
 
which ruby
/home/vagrant/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin/ruby
ruby -v
